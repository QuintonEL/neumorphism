# Neumorphism Design
### Mobile music player design built using ReactJS and SCSS. 
The focus of neumorphism is mainly on the color palette used. This soft interface style gives a feel that the components are protruding from the background, by using low contrast and the right amount of shadowing.

I added in a dark mode toggle as well, but the colors aren't quite as nice.
